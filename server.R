# With 60,000 nursing homes currently running in the country, it is difficult to find 
# one that best suits everyone's needs. The nursing home finder is the end to all of 
# your problems. This project is intended to ease the search process and help adults 
# (25 and above) find a perfect nursing home for their parent(s). We have based this 
# project on the official datasets available on the", a("medicare.gov", href = 'https://www.medicare.gov/'), 
# "Nursing Home Compare  Website provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. 
# This dataset allows one to compare the quality of care at every Medicare and Medicaid-certified Nursing 
# Home currently running in the country. This tool will help you compare nursing homes 
# in 50 states. Initially you would see the national map with a table showing the basic 
# provider information(Name, Phone Number, Address, City, State, Fines and Overall Rating). 
# You can choose a state from the drop down on the side, and you would see a close up map of 
# your state, with location maps for each nursing home. You can hover over the location pins to 
# see the names of the nursing homes. Below the map, the table is filtered to the specific stateâ€™s 
# nursing homes. You can also filter the overall rating (from 1 to 5), and see the nursing homes 
# with/without fines or all of them, according to your choices. This will further filter the location 
# points and the table. You can select a specific nursing home at a time, and then toggle between the 
# General Provider Information, Ratings and Penalties and Other Information for the specific nursing 
# home on the side. The General Information tab will show the Name, Address and the Phone Number of 
# the nursing homes. The Ratings and Penalties tab will show more specific ratings and penalties such 
# as Overall Rating, Health Inspection Rating, Staffing Rating, Registered Nurse Staffing Rating and 
# the Total Amount of fine due. The Other Information tab has information on the maximum capacity of 
# residents(that is, the number of certified beds), the current residents, the reported hours out of 
# expected hours for Certified Nursing Assistant(CNA), Licesened Practical Nurses (LPN), Registered Nurses(RN) 
# and for all nurses. You also have the ability to search the table and select the number of specific entires you 
# would like to see in the table. There is a glossary available for you to help understand the difference 
# between the different types of Nurses available and their respective information given in the table.")

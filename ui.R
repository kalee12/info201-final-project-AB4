                                       This tool will help you compare nursing homes in 50 states. Initially you would see the national map with a table 
                                       showing the basic provider information(Name, Phone Number, Address, City, State, Fines and Overall Rating). 
                                       You can choose a state from the drop down on the side, and you would see a close up map of your state, 
                                       with location maps for each nursing home. You can hover over the location pins to see the names of the nursing homes. 
                                       Below the map, the table is filtered to the specific stateâ€™s nursing homes. You can also filter the overall rating 
                                       (from 1 to 5), and see the nursing homes with/without fines or all of them, according to your choices. 
                                       This will further filter the location points and the table.

                                       You can select a specific nursing home at a time, and then toggle between the General Provider Information, 
                                       Ratings and Penalties and Other Information for the specific nursing home on the side. The General Information tab 
                                       will show the Name, Address and the Phone Number of the nursing homes. The Ratings and Penalties tab will show more 
                                       specific ratings and penalties such as Overall Rating, Health Inspection Rating, Staffing Rating, 
                                       Registered Nurse Staffing Rating and the Total Amount of fine due. The Other Information tab has 
                                       information on the maximum capacity of residents(that is, the number of certified beds), the current residents, 
                                       the reported hours out of expected hours for Certified Nursing Assistant(CNA), Licesened Practical Nurses (LPN),
                                       Registered Nurses(RN) and for all nurses.
